Shader program creation process

1. Getting the shader information in to the program. 

In this program, the task is done by the function, BuildShader, which manupilates the shader 
creation process through different functions.

2. Reading and getting content in shader files

This is done by sending the specific file name in to a function which reads and returns the content
in that file. The function may contain typical file handling (opening, reading and closing file through 
a file pointor) instructions.

3. Then creating the shaders

Another separate function has been used in this program to create the shaders. This function gets the 
returned content from the ReadShader function. Then creates and compiles the created shader using 
built in GL functions.

4. Attaching and Linking with the program

First we have to create a program and attache the all shaders which we are going to use. This is done by
the program "shaderprogram" using two GL functions ( glCreatProgram() and glAttachShader() ). Finally 
the cretaed program is linked with our main program using GL function, glLinkProgram().
