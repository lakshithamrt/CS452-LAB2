Steps of getting use of shaders

1. Creating the shader program

In this lab two shader programs were created, vertex shader and fragment shader. The positions and 
colors were input to the vertex shader in vector form. Then vertex shader sends the color information 
to fragment shader.

2. Loading shaders

Use a separate function for loading in LoadShaders1.cpp.  Used a header file LoadShaders.h which 
defines the type of shader information which should be input to the LoadShader function.

3. Compiling and Linking

Compiling and linking also were done with the help of same LoadShaders1.cpp and LoadShaders.h files. 
In order to do this we have to create a program object. then after the compilation we can attached the 
shaders with program object as in the source, LoadShaders1.cpp.

4. Using shaders

After transfering data to shaders and by giving the shader information accodring to the definition in the 
LoadShaders.h, we can make use of the shaders in the program.
